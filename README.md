# NCP Test Problems

This repository contains a collection of Nonlinear Complementarity Problems (NCPs) used for testing algorithms. Each problem includes the computation formulas and the initial values, including starting points.

## Contents

1. `NCP_Tests_computation.m` - MATLAB script containing the computation formulas for the NCPs.
2. `NCP_Tests_initialization.m` - MATLAB script containing the initialization data for the NCPs, including initial values and starting points.

## Description
**Example Structure:**
```matlab
% Define the NCP problem 'quarp'
Test = 'quarp';

% Initial values for NCP Problem 'quarp'
Tests_initialization

% Computation for NCP Problem 'quarp'
